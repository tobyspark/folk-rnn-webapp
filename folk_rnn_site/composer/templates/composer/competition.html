                        <p>The aim of this competition is to explore an application of machine learning to music – in particular the online tool at folkrnn.org. This model is an example of artificial intelligence trained on traditional tunes mainly Irish and English. The web interface allows users to generate new melodies using a few parameters (There's a video on the website that explains how it works). We are seeking works that make creative use of this tool to compose new pieces, which do not need to adhere to the idiom of the training material.</p>
                        <p>Submissions will be judged on their musical quality and their utilisation of outputs from folkrnn.org. The winning piece will be performed by a professional ensemble at a public concert in London, UK, in early October 2018. Professional recordings of the performance will be provided to composers, and with the permission of musicians and composers, made available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7wzmG64y2IbTUeWji_qKhA">the project youtube channel</a></p>
                        <p>We welcome submissions from any composer without restriction of age or nationality. Attendance at the concert is not mandatory. There is no cost for submitting a work.</p>
