            <h1><a href="/">Folk RNN</a></h1>
            <p>folk-rnn is a computer model that generates transcriptions in <a href="http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1" target="_blank">ABC format</a>. This model was trained on about 23,000 transcriptions collected from <a href="http://thesession.org" target="_blank">http://thesession.org</a>. This website provides an interface to this model so that you can create your own new tunes. (More technical information about this model, as well as links to several compositions created using it, can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/IraKorshunova/folk-rnn" target="_blank">folk-rnn project webpage</a>.)</p>
