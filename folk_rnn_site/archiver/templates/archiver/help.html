        <p>We are <a href="{% url 'user' user_id=2 %}">Bob</a> and <a href="{% url 'user' user_id=3 %}">Oded</a>. We run The Machine Folk Session. If you need any help, let us know.</p>
        <p>We were inspired by the site <a href="http://thesession.org">The Session</a>, a community website dedicated to Irish traditional music. We'd like to do what that site and community have done for trad tunes for music generated by machines, or co-created with them.</p>

    <div class="section-body">
        <h3>Be civil</h3>
        <p>Contributions should be constructive and polite, not mean-spirited or contributed with the intention of causing trouble.</p>
        <p>Foul language or aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated. While machine folk may be experimental in nature, the community norms we require are no different to those at <a href="https://thesession.org/help#houserules">The Session</a>. Try to remember these kinds of online communities consist of people of all ages and cultural backgrounds.</p>
        <h3>Please stay on topic</h3>
        <p>Please keep your contributions relevant to music generated by, or co-created with, machines.</p>
        <h3>No spamming</h3>
        <p>Please don’t submit the same thing more than once.</p>
        <h3>Please use your own name</h3>
        <p>You can choose any name you want for your membership, but please don’t hide behind a pseudonym with any expectation of anonymity. The Session is not a place for making anonymous remarks.</p>
        <h3>No duplicate memberships</h3>
        <p>It’s strictly one membership per person here at The Session. Anyone caught faking a new membership will be expelled.</p>
        <p>Remember, you can update your email address, name and other preferences from your member profile.</p>

        <h3>Why should I become a member?</h3>
        <p>Everyone is free to browse around The Machine Folk Session, look at tunes and read comments. However, if you’re a member, you'll also be able to contribute tune settings and post your own comments.</p>
        <p>Best of all, members can select tunes they like and add them to their own personal tunebook. You can then download an ABC file of all the tunes in your tunebook. This is a lot easier than downloading tunes individually and then cutting and pasting them into a larger ABC file.</p>
        <h3>How do I become a member?</h3>
        <p>When you sign up to become a member, you will be asked to give your name and email address, and choose a password.</p>
        <p>You can then use your email address and password to log in to The Machine Folk Session and begin submitting tune settings, posting comments and adding tunes to your tunebook. You can change your name, email and password at any time.</p>
        <h3>I’ve forgotten my password!</h3>
        <p>To have a password reset link sent to you, go to the log-in page and click on the forgotten your password? link. Enter the email address you used to sign up with.</p>
        <h3>Do I have to provide an email address?</h3>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>Your email address will NOT be displayed anywhere on The Session.</p>
        <p>Your email address will NOT be given or sold to any third party.</p>
        <p>Your email address WILL be used to block you from The Session if you break the rules while you’re here.</p>
        <h3>Can I change my name, password or email address?</h3>
        <p>Sure. Just log in and go to your member profile. You will see options there for changing any of your details.</p>
        <h3>How do I submit a tune?</h3>
        <p>First of all, make sure that the tune isn’t already listed by doing a search. If the tune is already listed, you can log in and add your setting to the existing listing.</p>
        <p>If the tune isn’t yet listed, log in and click on the Add a tune button in the tunes section. Then follow the on-screen instructions. You’ll need to submit the tune in ABC notation.</p>
        <h3>What’s ABC notation?</h3>
        <p>ABC is a great way of passing on tunes by writing the notes out in plain text.</p>
        <p>It's very straightforward and easy to learn. You can find out more on the ABC notation site.</p>
        <h3>Can I submit an alternate setting of a tune that’s already listed?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Log in. Go to the tune and click on the “Add a setting” button.</p>
        <h3>What is my tunebook?</h3>
        <p>The Session allows you to collect tunes and add them to a virtual tunebook. The tunebook is really just a list of tunes that you have selected. You can download the entire tunebook as a single ABC file.</p>
        <p>To add a tune to your tunebook, log in, go to the tune in question and click on the “Add to tunebook” button.</p>
